TIY Week 1, Day 3: Puppies CSS Design Project
Learning CSS basics

Puppy Love is a one page site about, well... a love of puppies.

This assessment tests your basic knowledge of CSS and styling. Feel free to reference the activities related to CSS for hints about how to style some of the trickier components of this project.

This assignment is individual. You cannot work with another student.

Your task is to review index.png and index.html and to write the CSS to match the mockup.

At the end of this project, your HTML file, when rendered in the browser, should closely match the mockup.
